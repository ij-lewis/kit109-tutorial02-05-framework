      Title:
        m_Untranslated: Line 37 - Moving Objects with (the) Force
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "<code>Vector2 thrust = transform.up * thrustSpeed;\r\nGetComponent&lt;Rigidbody2D&gt;().AddForce(thrust);\r\n</code>\r\n<b>YOU
          CAN SKIP OVER READING THIS PAGE IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN MATHS :) </b>\r\nThe
          code inside the final if statement first determines the thrust amount (force)
          to apply to the rigidbody. A <doc>Rigidbody2D</doc> expects force to be
          described using a <doc>Vector2</doc> which has a direction and a magnitude.
          The direction is first determined on <b>line 35</b> to be the direction
          the spaceship is pointing (note this is different to the direction the
          spaceship is moving). This direction is then multiplied by the thrustSpeed
          public variable from line 11.\r\nNotice the use of transform.up. Again,
          we are accessing the transform component, but this time we are accessing
          a property that is not visible in the Unity inspector. In this case we
          are accessing a computed property \u201Cup\u201D which represents the local
          Y-axis of the player object.\r\nTry changing transform.up to Vector3.up
          (note the capitalization, accessing the static up direction). The code
          is now using the world Y-axis. What happens? Switch the code back to transform.up
          before continuing.\r\nSee the following for more help on vector maths:\r\n\u2022
          <a>http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnderstandingVectorArithmetic.html</a>\r\n\u2022
          Vector Maths: <a>https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/scripting/vector-maths</a>\r\nFinally,
          the calculated thrust value is given the Rigidbody2D component using its
          AddForce(Vector2) function on line 37. In order to access the <doc>Rigidbody2D</doc>
          component, the GetComponent&lt;Type&gt;() function is used (note that in
          previous versions of Unity a shortcut like the transform variable was provided
          for the Rigidbody2D component, but this has since been deprecated). Note
          that the best practice (which is not being followed here) is to \u201Ccache\u201D
          the component in a public variable once at the start of the game and access
          the component through this variable, rather than searching for the component
          every frame (which is an expensive operation). See the exercise at the
          end of this practical to see how the caching approach works. \r\nFor more
          information on the GetComponent function, see:\r\n\u2022 <doc>GameObject.GetComponent</doc>
