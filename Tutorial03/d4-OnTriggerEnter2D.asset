      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "The OnTriggerEnter2D method will be called whenever the
          Game Object collides with another Game Object (or technically their colliders
          collide/overlap). It has a single parameter of type Collider2D, which is
          the Collider2D Component of the Game Object it has collided with.\r\nInside
          your <asset>MoveToRandomPositionOnCollision</asset> class definition, you
          can add the following code to implement this function (you can avoid some
          typing by using Ctrl+Shift+Q here \u2013 although it will call the variable
          collision rather than other):\r\n<code>\nvoid OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D
          other)\r\n{\r\n   \r\n}\r\n</code>\r\nThis function will be called whenever
          another collider overlaps with this trigger. Unfortunately, this includes
          not only the player, but enemies, and bullets as well. For this game we
          only want the pick up to function when the player collides with it. This
          is where the parameter to OnTriggerEnter2D comes in. We can access information
          about the object that collided with us, and decide what to do with that
          information. \nIn this case, we can <b>change</b> our OnTriggerEnter2D
          code to check to see that the other object was indeed the player:\n<code>\r\nvoid
          OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)\r\n{\r\n\tif (other.CompareTag(\"Player\"))\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t//code
          here will happen only for the Player\n\t}\n}\n</code>\r\nThis if-statement
          uses the <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Component.CompareTag.html\">CompareTag</a>
          function to check the tag of the other object. The parameter to this function
          is the tag to check for, and the result is true if the tag matches that
          of the parameter. \nNOTE: at the moment this comment \"code here will happen
          only for the Player\" suggests this will be true immediately -- this isn't
          true, we haven't set up the Player game object to <i>have</i> this tag
          yet (and it's got nothing to do with the <i>name</i> of the game object
          being \"Player\"). Setting this tag up corectly is the next step."
