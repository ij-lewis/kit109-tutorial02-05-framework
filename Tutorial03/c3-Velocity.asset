        m_Untranslated: "<code>\n// get the velocity (i.e. direction and speed) of
          the ship's movement\nVector2 shipVelocity = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody2D&gt;().velocity;\n\n//
          get the direction the ship is facing\r\nVector2 shipDirection = transform.up;\r\n\r\n//
          set the bullet's velocity (direction and speed) to be the current speed
          of the player ship\r\n// PLUS the angle the ship is facing multiplied by
          the bullet's speed\r\nbullet.GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody2D&gt;().velocity
          = shipVelocity + shipDirection * bulletSpeed;\n</code>\nOnce this <asset>Bullet</asset>
          Prefab copy/clone has been created on line 13 we first get some information
          about the ship (lines 16 and 19).\n\nLine 16 gets the velocity (i.e. the
          direction and speed) of the player ship and stores it in a variable <c>shipVelocity</c>.\n\nLine
          19 gets a vector representing the \"up\" direction of the player ship.
          It might seem that \"up\" always points up the screen, but an object's
          transform can have changes applied, in our case, the ship can be rotated,
          and so \"up\" represents the direction the ship is currently facing. \nNote:\n\u2022
          This \"up\" vector is always of length 1 (i.e. it has no speed associated
          with it), so we can think about it as a direction.\n\u2022 There's also
          a <c>transform.right</c> which can be useful (but no \"down\" or \"left\",
          you just use a minus to get those). \n\u2022 See <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html\">Transform
          </a>, in the unity docs, for more information. Specifically <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-up.html\">Transform.up</a>
          and <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-right.html\">Transform.right</a>.\n\nFinally,
          line 23 sets the bullet's velocity to be calculated based upon the combination
          of the player ship's movement, the direction the ship is facing, and the
          <c>bulletSpeed</c> public variable.\n"
