        m_Untranslated: Notes About Mulit-Scene Editing
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "Having multiple scenes open doesn\u2019t affect the actual
          game if you were to build it as an EXE\u2014we have just made the editing
          process simpler. The build of the game will always start with scene 0 by
          itself\u2014it is up to you to write code which loads in other scenes.
          We will come to such code later in this practical.\nYou can right-click
          on the scene in the hierarchy pane to either unload the scene (which keeps
          it in the hierarchy, but removes the game objects it contains), or remove
          the scene. You can also set a scene as the \u201CActive\u201D scene. This
          means that new objects instantiated using <c>GameObject.Instantiate()</c> will
          appear in the active scene.\r\nNote that you can\u2019t link game objects
          between scenes, even though they may be both open in the hierarchy pane.
          You can however move objects between scenes.\r"
